            <p>The year 2014 started by a highlighted intervention at the Aporta 2014 meeting, where <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/01/chocamos-contra-un-muro-no-nos-dan-los-datos-david-cabo-en-aporta-2014/" title="Civio - “We hit the wall: they deny us data”- David Cabo at Aporta 2014" target="_blank">we reclaimed a true «open data culture»</a> prioritising citizens' needs. Along this year we have fostered or contributed to campaigns such as:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><strong>Lobbying transparency</strong>: jointly with other civil society regulations, we launched a set of <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/02/propuestas-de-la-sociedad-civil-para-regular-el-lobby-en-espana/" title="Civio - Proposals for Spanish lobby regulation" target="_blank">proposals for Spanish lobby regulation</a> according to international standards and upon consultation to civil society.</p>

              <li>
                <p><strong>Transparency in adviser appointments</strong>: we <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/04/preguntamos-en-moncloa-por-los-avances-en-transparencia/" title="Civio - Asking the Spanish Government about transparency advancements" target="_blank">gathered and handed over 47,868 signatures personally in the Spanish government palace</a> requesting the publication on the Official Gazette of any appointment of advisers by ministers and the President, disclosing their tasks, their duties and their professional experience. In February 2015, <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/02/al-fin-sabemos-quienes-asesoran-al-gobierno-como-reclamabamos-desde-2013/" title="Civio - We finally learn who advises the Government, as we had been requesting since 2013" target="_blank">the Government finally published the list of ad hoc advisers</a>, non-officials, hired by the President's office and by every one of the 13 ministries since the beginning of the term, the service provided and the gross remuneration perceived up to the last closed financial year.</p>
              </li>

                <p><strong>Obstacles to the right of access to information upon Transparency Act entry into force</strong>: On December 10th, the Transparency Act came into force and we became, along with Access Info Europe, the <a href="http://www.civio.es/dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/NP_En-vigor-ley-de-transparencia_201412101.pdf" title=" Civio - The Government puts constraints on the access to information upon Transparency Act entry into force" target="_blank">information source of choice for the reporting of technical obstacles</a> hindering the right of citizens to request information. We held a meeting with ElConfidencial.com and we answered the 24 questions proposed. Since then, we keep working in order to help public administration reduce such obstacles substantially.</p>
