          <p>Our relationship with public administration is <strong>transparent</strong> and <strong>disclosed to the public</strong>, which includes <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/04/preguntamos-en-moncloa-por-los-avances-en-transparencia/" title="Civio - Asking the Spanish Government about transparency advancements" target="_blank">meetings</a>. Without this cooperation and approach to the institutions and decision makers, implementing transparency practices would become much harder. Any authority that shows a firm commitment towards opening public information can count, if they wish, on our active collaboration.</p>
          <p>In 2014, Civio has been <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/04/preguntamos-en-moncloa-por-los-avances-en-transparencia/" title="Civio - Asking the Spanish Government about transparency advancements" target="_blank">open for collaboration at any time</a> with the authorities in charge of implementing the <strong>Transparency Act</strong>, even though very little success has been attained at influencing them. A much more fruitful cooperation took place with the Executive while elaborating the <strong>2nd Open Government Action Plan</strong>. We proposed a more strategic approach, more in line with the principles of Open Government Partnership (OGP). Several of such <a href="http://www.civio.es/dev/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Recomendaciones_Civio_Plan-OGP_v31.pdf" title="Civio recommendations for Spain's 2nd Open Government Action Plan." target="_blank">recommendations</a> were reflected on the definitive plan. Notwithstanding, a long way lies ahead for such plans in Spain to comply with international demands. Especially, this regards the inclusion of civil society within participation processes.</p>
          <p>Regarding transition projects in autonomous communities, the Spanish territorial divisions with transferred powers, towards a more transparent governance, during 2014 we have been contributing towards the enhancement of <strong>Catalonia's Transparency Act</strong> (for the dissemination of all institutional advertising from bodies depending on the Catalonian Government); we were called in as independent experts during the Principality of Asturias parliament advisory days to issue recommendations for <strong>Asturias Transparency Act</strong>; we have written <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/06/carta-a-los-diputados-andaluces-sobre-el-pl-de-transparencia-de-andalucia/" title="Civio - A letter to Andalusian MPs on the Transparency draft act for Andalusia" target="_blank">to the members of the Andalusian parliament</a> in the face of the final debate for the draft <strong>Andalusian Public Transparency Act</strong> and shared our recommendations in the light of the <strong>ordinance for transparency within the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces</strong> for local authorities, who also <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/06/valoracion-de-civio-sobre-la-nueva-ordenanza-de-transparencia-de-la-femp-para-entes-locales/" title="Civio - Civio's advice on Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces' ordinance for transparency" target="_blank">adopted</a> some of them. Besides, we helped to enrich the <strong>Spanish Association of Foundations' Transparency Code</strong> (Asociación Española de Fundaciones: AEF).</p>
          <p>This attitude for public collaboration within the axes of transparency, accountability and active citizenship remains a priority for 2015.</p>
