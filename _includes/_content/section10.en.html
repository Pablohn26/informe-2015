              <p>Over <strong>half a million unique users</strong> have used our tools in 2014 in order to have access to better information on public administration and to play a more active part in society. More and more citizens, organizations, bodies, social movements and public officers of all fields are contributing to the public debate we foster, based upon <strong>evidence and free access to data</strong>.</p>

              <p>We have participated and affected processes for the adaptation to transparency in autonomous community, municipality and sector levels. As a result of our recommendations, the policy support of public access to information has been <strong>strengthened and increased with better practices</strong> that will benefit thousands of citizens and organizations.</p>

              <p>We set <strong>ambitious objectives</strong> for ourselves that, thanks to a continuous and well grounded endeavour, they become likely at first and then real. In October 2013, we asked all the groups of the parliament to make their <strong>working and meeting schedules</strong> public. Throughout that year, several groups have been following this recommendation by Civio, and they even have requested the Congress to make its publication compulsory. In November 2014, the Congress started to publish on their website the schedules of deputies that were proactively requesting so. By the end of the year, <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/02/cuatro-partidos-publican-ya-las-agendas-completas-de-trabajo-y-reuniones-de-todos-sus-diputados/" title="Civio - Four parties have already published their MPs' working and meeting schedules in full" target="_blank">four parties</a> (EUiA, Coalició Compromís, UPyD and ICV) already had fully public schedules and 117 MPs out of 350 willingly link to their schedules from the website of the Congress. In 2015 we will <strong>give renewed impetus</strong> to this line of action.</p>

              <p>The civic purpose of our initiatives is fulfilled when we are able to <strong>transform data into useful information and knowledge at the service of other citizens and <a href="https://twitter.com/ayudaenaccion/status/524922530847789056" target="_blank">organizations</a></strong>. If in 2013 we talked about a <a href="http://www.civio.es/2013/03/la-cantera-de-la-transparencia/" title="Civio - A reserve of transparency" target="_blank">secondary school in Tomelloso</a>, in 2014 we can mention the teachers from the Oviedo University for the Elderly programme who have used <a href="http://dondevanmisimpuestos.es" title="¿Dónde van mis impuestos?" target="_blank">¿Dónde van mis impuestos?</a> in their "Keys to understand business and economics news" workshop. It is used also in Applied Economics within Madrid Complutense University, in subjects such as "Introduction to Economics" or "Public Administration Economics". El indultómetro, also, has served as a basis for studies in Law and Criminology.</p>

              <p>Out of modest means, Civio is able to deliver true <strong>public service information</strong>. <a href="http://elboenuestrodecadadia.com" title="El BOE nuestro de cada día" target="_blank">El BOE nuestro de cada día</a> was the only information source that unravelled, for all citizens, the contents of the 172-page coup de decree, published on a July Saturday, and that would amend as a matter of urgency and without parliamentary approval. Three opposition groups appealed such measures before the Constitutional Court, who admitted the appeal and have yet to pronounce their sentence. Another article published in this blog led, thanks to UPyD party members of the regional assembly taking up the torch, to <a href="http://us4.campaign-archive2.com/?u=9416fe6b76f2c3f985c1f8e0f&amp;id=8f7fe87257" title="Civio - One (more) little victory" target="_blank">Madrid Autonomous Community institutional advertising changing</a>, for it was clearly showing pre-election self-promotion, which is unlawful.</p>

              <p>We go on raising the bar for transparency and open data good practice. And <strong>we are not the ones to say so</strong>. The Orange foundation, one more year in their <a href="https://www.proyectosfundacionorange.es/docs/eE2014/Informe_eE2014.pdf" title="Fundación Orange - Annual report on information society development in Spain España 2014" target="_blank">Open Data report</a>, praised the budget transparency portals of the Basque Country and Aragon, that emerged out of the first version of <a href="http://dondevanmisimpuestos.es" title="¿Dónde van mis impuestos?" target="_blank">¿Dónde van mis impuestos?</a>, developed by David Cabo, as a good <strong>example to follow</strong>. Moreover, the methodology guide for <a href="http://datos.gob.es/sites/default/files/informe-opendata-sectorial.pdf" title="datos.gob.es - Methodology guide for sectoral open data planning">sectoral open data planning</a> of the Ministry for Industry, Energy and Tourism and the Ministry of Public Administration and Finance <strong>recommends</strong> the <a href="http://escuela.civio.es" title="Escuela Civio" target="_blank">Civio school</a> as an example to create repositories of training resources. And the <a href="http://towcenter.org/the-art-and-science-of-data-driven-journalism/" title="Tow Center - The Art and Science of Data-Driven Journalism" target="_blank">The Art and Science of Data-driven Journalism</a> report of Columbia Journalism School underlines the work of the foundation of bring out data journalism in a country that still did not count on a transparency act.</p>

              <p>But our best victory has been to conclude 2014 with <strong>positive balance</strong>, a <strong>growing and consolidating team</strong>, the motivation to face <strong>new challenges</strong> in 2015 and the confidence to commit to our donors and followers to stay up to their expectations.</p>
