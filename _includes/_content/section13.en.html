              <p>Keeping a constant attitude of closeness and cooperation with institutions works and is worth the while. It constitutes a <strong>medium- and long-term effort</strong>, that may entail frustration when promises of transparency do not show enough political will to support them. However, <strong>close and strategic cooperation</strong> is the only way that has sometimes worked.</p>

              <p>Lack of transparency and stillness by authorities <strong>always come at a price</strong>. When institutions stop replying to requests, citizens become disaffected from transparency, stop seeking information and it <strong>entails a serious damage</strong>. We could confirm so after the decrease of requests in Tuderechoasaber.es. <a href="http://www.itspublicknowledge.info/home/AboutSIC/CommissionerBiography.aspx" target="_blank">Rosemary Agnew</a>, director of Scottish Information Commissioner's office, stated as follows in 2013: "failing to respond doesn't make requests go away, but just creates unnecessary extra work and increases costs. Failure to respond generates complaints, review requests, and appeals to my office, and <strong>damages a public authority's reputation</strong>. The most efficient option is to get it right first time". We concur completely with it.</p>

              <p>In Spain, the tissue of organizations (those having stable teams and rigorous methodology) specialized in the field of transparency and right to access is still at <strong>a very early stage compared with other countries</strong>. The lack of funding opportunities, both public and private, makes essential to face outward in order to find models, success stories and a strategic vision on transparency and activism in the long run. That said, we add up more and more national initiatives little by little. From Hay Derecho foundation to the +Democracia initiative, from Qué hacen los diputados to Graba tu pleno (Record the council), OKFN, Openkratio, the CIECODE Avizor project or Kuorum, are just a few of the main ones. They all contribute to a richer debate and develop valuable proposals. We hope we can cooperate actively with all of them in order to attain a more efficient and influential network.</p>

              <p>Learning how to manage pro bono work and collaborations is complicated and time-consuming. Many people are willing to help and put a bit of themselves, but making good use of it takes effort and resources. We have <strong>a lot to learn in order to channel such energy</strong> in a way that is rewarding for volunteers and organizers, but during 2014 we were able to see some fruits of our labour: we received leads for stories in "Quién Manda" and pictures for the Fotomandón; in March, <a href="https://twitter.com/pipo02mix" title="Fernando Ripoll" target="_blank">Fernando Ripoll</a> redisigned "El BOE nuestro de cada día", and we love it more and more; <strong>Irene de la Torre</strong> prepared a <a href="http://quienmanda.es/posts/el-pilar" title="Quién Manda - El Pilar school" target="_blank">wonderful visualization for the articles on El Pilar school</a> in "Quién Manda"; <strong>Julian Hauser</strong> helped us by analysing a variety of international laws on transparency and lobbying regulation; <strong>Mauro Entrialgo</strong> is the author of the amazing t-shirts that we handed to the "Quién Manda" crowdfunding donors; <strong>Jaime Gómez Obregón</strong> gave us the idea to introduce "Mind The Bank"; <strong>Antonio Villarreal</strong> wrote a fantastic <a href="http://elboenuestrodecadadia.com/2014/03/25/nuclenor-inscribe-un-nuevo-convenio-colectivo-para-la-central-de-garona/" title="El BOE nuestro de cada día - Nuclenor files a new collective bargaining agreement for the Garoña station" target="_blank">article in "El BOE nuestro de cada día"</a> as guest poster; <strong>Juan Elosua</strong> helped us, as he always does, to update the data in "El indultómetro", among other things. And many more. So, <strong>many thanks to every one of you!</strong></p>

              <p>The <strong>diversification</strong> of income sources is essential for sustainability and growth in an organization that receives no state help. The provision of marketable services, based in <strong>specialised knowledge</strong> and with a <strong>high added vale</strong>, is a key pillar for our growth. Pilots and good practice, like adoption of ¿Dónde van mis impuestos? in municipalities like Torrelodones passes on and generate very positive exposure.</p>

              <p>Large international donors request <strong>very high standards of professionalism and diligence</strong>. Being a foundation or any other kind of not-for-profit organization does not exempt anyone from being accountable, in a detailed way, at all. These large donors mean a positive boost towards the implementation of <strong>better international practices</strong> on governance and society dynamics. As well as advancing more and more in attained <strong>impact measurement</strong> is critical to them.</p>

              <p>Civio's future relies on its <strong>accomplices</strong>, of our regular donor community. They allow us to plan our labour properly, and free us from depending solely on service provision, winning international contests or getting <i>grants</i>. Every donor is different, every donor has priorities and incentives of their own. Donating for an organization to foster institutional transparency is not whimsical nor intuitive. We must prove on a day-to-day basis, in every decision made, <strong>out of precision and reliability</strong>, that their support is worth it.</p>
