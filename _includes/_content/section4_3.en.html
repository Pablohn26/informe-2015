            <p>2014 has been the first full year with the Quién Manda (Who Rules) running. This project maps public-private relationships in Spain and has been checked by 118,766 unique users. During this year we have added up to our database 1,450 new profiles for <a href="http://quienmanda.es/people" title="Quién Manda - People"  target="_blank">people</a> and <a href="http://quienmanda.es/organizations" title="Quién Manda - Organizations" target="_blank">bodies</a> (which now total over 3,800) as well as 2,031 new relationships, including appointments, family links, membership in foundation and company boards, honours awarded, among others. The project displays over 5,800 relationships now, out of which 2,000 have been uploaded automatically and the rest manually. Our purpose is to load more information automatically than manually during 2015.</p>

            <p>We have also published 28 new <a href="http://quienmanda.es/posts" title="Quién Manda - Articles" target="_blank">articles</a> and added up 88 new images on our <a href="http://quienmanda.es/photos" target="_blank">send-a-picture</a> feature. The articles on who <a href="http://quienmanda.es/posts/aede" title="Quién Manda - What are the members of AEDE, the publishers' association defending copy levy?" target="_blank">make part of AEDE</a> (and back the "copy levy"), Juan Carlos I's <a href="http://quienmanda.es/posts/la-ultima-cena" title="Quién Manda - A king's last supper" target="_blank">last supper</a>, right before abdicating, with his entourage and the <a href="http://quienmanda.es/posts/el-pilar" title="Quién Manda - El Pilar school" target="_blank">lines of influential individuals</a> graduated from El Pilar school have been the stories attracting more traffic and <a href="http://quienmanda.es/posts/la-ultima-cena" title="El Confidencial - La última cena del Rey (A king's last supper)" target="_blank">some of them have been reposted</a> in media like El Confidencial.</p>
            <p>"Quién Manda" comes with a proposal for change: encouraging people in high-ranking offices to display their working and meeting schedules. In January 2014 we published the <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/01/las-agendas-de-trabajo-de-los-diputados-inaccesibles-para-el-ciudadano/" title="Civio - MP working schedules, out of the citizens' reach" target="_blank">first analysis</a> of transparency in working schedules of parliament groups. We realized that most of them were out of the reach of citizens, and that ICV and CHA were the parties that had implemented the best practices. The <a href="http://www.civio.es/2014/07/transparencia-parlamentaria-icv-cha-y-upyd-publican-integramente-las-agendas-de-trabajo-de-sus-diputados/" title="Civio - Parliamentary transparency: ICV, CHA and UPyD publish their MPs' working schedules in full" target="_blank">second analysis</a>, made in July, disclosed some advancements and UPyD joined ICV and CHA as parties with the most transparent schedules. Our <a href="http://www.civio.es/2015/02/cuatro-partidos-publican-ya-las-agendas-completas-de-trabajo-y-reuniones-de-todos-sus-diputados/" title="Civio - Four parties have already published their MPs' working and meeting schedules in full" target="_blank">third analysis</a>, in 2015, lays bare how, despite the Congress prefers not to formulate binding rules, more and more groups are adopting the good practice of granting public access to their schedules.</p>
            <p>Bad news is that it has not been possible to implement the technical enhancements proposed for 2014. Good news is that many of such enhancements are on their way and they will soon be available.</p>
