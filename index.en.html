            <p>This annual report of Civio (Civio Civic Foundation) is an accountability practice that allows us to explain our pursuit, make all relevant information on our activities public and to share both positive and negative aspects of our evolution. We have adopted this format for the first time this year and we count on reviewing every period in an honest, critical and constructive way. We endeavour to raise the bar and to keep working in a self-demanding and enthusiastic manner, in order to keep the trust we already count on from so many citizens and to earn more and more every day.</p>
